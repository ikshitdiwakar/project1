Project 1 – Fun & Learn Personal Details Form is an interactive web application created using HTML, CSS, Flask (Python), and PostgreSQL. It allows users to enter and submit their personal details — including Name, Phone Number, Email ID, and City or State — through a friendly and responsive form. Upon submission, the user’s information is stored temporarily and displayed back on the page. The site also supports a logout feature that removes the user’s data from the database and clears the session.

The design is clean and intuitive, making it easy for visitors to fill out and submit their details. The navigation bar includes links like Hindi Varnamala, Alphabet, Cross Word, Rhyming Words, Paint & Fun, Tech Parts, and Logout, suggesting an educational or interactive theme as well. Overall, this project showcases full-stack development skills — integrating the frontend form with a backend database, session handling, and dynamic content display.
